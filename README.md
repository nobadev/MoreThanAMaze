# More Than A Maze - Unity C#

This project is used as material for coursework to showcase an interface with on-screen controls, similar to one in a 3D mobile game. Also contains basic jump and dash controls, and some extra experimental stuff to learn about more about the engine.

Used ProBuilder for level design.
